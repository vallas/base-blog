Here is an example Git deployment script:

Copy code
#!/bin/bash

# Pull the latest code from the Git repository
git pull origin master

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build the project
npm run build

# Restart the server
service my_web_server restart
To improve this script, you could add more error handling, such as checking the exit codes of each command and making sure that the dependencies are installed correctly. You could also include options to specify the branch to pull from, and the server to restart.
