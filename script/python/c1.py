# 0. Introduction to the project

# 1. Installing the required packages:

# Install necessary tools and libraries
# !pip install python requests bs4 nltk
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import nltk

# 2. Designing the overall architecture:
# Define the data structure for storing website snapshots
# Define data structure for storing website data
class Website:
    def __init__(self, url):
        self.url = url
        self.html = None
        self.tokens = []
        self.word_frequencies = {}
        self.summary = None

# 3. Fetching the website data:
# Define a function for fetching the HTML of a website
def fetch_html(url):
    # Send a request to the website and return its HTML
    response = requests.get(url)
    return response.text
    
class Snapshot:
    def __init__(self, url, timestamp, html, text):
        self.url = url
        self.timestamp = timestamp
        self.html = html
        self.text = text
        
# Define the workflow for crawling and archiving websites
def crawl(url):
    # Scrape the website's HTML and extract its text
    html = requests.get(url).text
    text = BeautifulSoup(html).get_text()
    
    # Create a snapshot of the website and store it in the database
    snapshot = Snapshot(url, datetime.now(), html, text)
    db.insert(snapshot)

# 3. Implementing the core components:
# Define a function for scraping the HTML of a website
def scrape_html(url):
    # Send a request to the website and return its HTML
    response = requests.get(url)
    return response.text
    
# Define a function for extracting the text from a website's HTML
def extract_text(html):
    # Use BeautifulSoup to parse the HTML and extract the text
    soup = BeautifulSoup(html)
    return soup.get_text()

# 4. Adding additional features and capabilities:   
# Define a function for handling changes to a website
def handle_changes(url):
    # Get the latest snapshot of the website from the database
    snapshot = db.get_latest(url)
    
    # Compare the latest snapshot to the current version of the website
    current_html = scrape_html(url)
    current_text = extract_text(current_html)
    
    if snapshot.html != current_html or snapshot.text != current_text:
        # Update the snapshot with the new version of the website
        snapshot.timestamp = datetime.now()
        snapshot.html = current_html
        snapshot.text = current_text
        db.update(snapshot)

# 5. Testing and debugging the code:
# Define a function for testing the crawler
def test_crawler(urls):
    # Crawl each of the provided URLs
    for url in urls:
        crawl(url)
    
    # Check the database for the expected number of snapshots
    assert db.count() == len(urls)
    
    # Check the database for the expected snapshot data
    for url, snapshot in db.get_all():
        assert snapshot.url == url
        assert snapshot.timestamp is not None
        assert snapshot.html is not None
        assert snapshot.text is not None
